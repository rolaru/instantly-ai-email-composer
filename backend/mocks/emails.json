Teams like Growthify and LeadBridge use our platform to shave 3–5 hours/week off manual prospect research while lifting reply rates ~18%.\n\nWould a 12‑minute screenshare tomorrow at 10:30am or 2:00pm work to show how we enrich and personalize first-touch emails automatically?\n\nBest,\nAlex\nSenior AE | OurStartup"

I’ve re-issued the invites and attached a 2‑minute loom walking through activation.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Have them click the fresh links (expire in 24h)\n2. Connect their Google Workspace mailboxes\n3. Import the starter prospect list (template attached)\n\nPing me once steps 1–2 are done and I can pre-load snippets for them.\n\nCheers,\nDana\nCustomer Success"

Several multi-location retailers (ShopHub, UrbanTrail) cut outbound tooling spend 27% by consolidating sequencing + intent enrichment into our single workflow.\n\nIf I outline a quick ROI model using your public headcount + average send volume, would that be helpful? Happy to send before asking for a meeting.\n\nLet me know—can turn it around today.\n\nRegards,\nMarco\nAccount Executive"
